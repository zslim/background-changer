# Bash-based background changer for Ubuntu

## Story behind the project

There's one thing about Windows 10 I find fascinating: the beautiful background pictures of the lock screen. So when I switched to Ubuntu I really missed them. I figured I wanted to set them as background pictures on my desktop. After I'd downloaded the pictures through some Microsoft app, I was having trouble having them changed from time to time. Although the solution was right in front of me the whole time, I still want to come up with my own one as I think a background changer app would be a nice task for me to practice bash scripting.

I have Ubuntu 18.10 (cosmic) on my laptop so that's what I'm working with.
